            Western theatre started in Ancient Greece and Rome, so it's only natural that we start there for our
            exploration of the monologue.

            <h6>Greek Theatre</h6>
            <p>
                In early Greek theatre, there would be only one actor, along with a chorus. In the fifth century,
                Aeschylus introduced a the concept of using a second actor- what an idea! Later, around the time of
                Sophocles, the three-actor convention was firmly cemented. Oscar Beckett's <i>History of The Theatre</i>
                goes into this in more detail, if you're interested.
            </p>

            <h6>Roman Monologues</h6>
            <p> Prescott states that "The liberal use of solo speech and solo song is the most distinctive feature in
                the technique of Roman Comedy". Often, they were used to communicate important events to the audience,
                or to tell the audience where and when the play is happening. Link monologues were used to sustain the
                flow of action, or to fill time.
                Exit monologues interrupt the current flow of action in order to make room for new events. Prescott
                defines three types of monologue: the true exit monologue, the quasi-monologue, and the entrance-exit
                monologue. The quasi-monologue shares some similarites with a soliloquy- it is spoken in the presence of
                other characters but not meant to be heard by them. The entrance-exit monologue is a special type of
                exit monologue where a character enters at the start of his speech and leaves at the end of it.
