# theatre-project
A simple site made for a research project in THEA113. The project was to research a theatre convention that had been previously presented in lectures, and my choice was the monologue.
I used HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript to create this very simple site in order to present my research. The full site can be seen at https://thea113-research-project.netlify.app (Warning: Shakespeare rants).
