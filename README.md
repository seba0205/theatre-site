# theatre-site
A very simple static site made to display some work for THEA103 last year. Made using HTML, CSS, and a pinch of JavaScript.


Consists of 4 pages- one home page, then one page for each area of research I looked into. These were: monologues in ancient Greece and Rome; Shakespearean Sololioques; and the work of Franca Rame. 

My original project included audio and video of me describing this research, which I have removed from this version.
