        <p>
            In recent times, the monologue has been noted for it's political use- the act of speaking directly to the
            audience is one that is deeply provoking. Franca Rame is one of the playrights that I admire the most.

            <p> Medea is Rame’s retelling of Euripedes’ Medea. There are multiple voices within the monologue, yet it is
                all performed by one person, switching between a chorus and Medea herself. In Rame’s version, Medea
                comes to see herself as a victim of oppression. She becomes understandable, rather than an otherworldly
                and strange creature, Rame’s work turns Medea into a women rooted in the earth, in reality, as
                translator Gillain Hanna puts it. Hanna, an actress and translator, said that “each performer (of Medea)
                should use any regional accent with which she feels most comfortable and adapt the text using regional
                colloquialism as necessary”, making Medea modern and familiar, in a way.
